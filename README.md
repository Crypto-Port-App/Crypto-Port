Crypto Port is an open-source, performant and secure desktop app to track your favorite crypto coins. To achieve this, it's made in [Tauri](https://tauri.app), [React](https://reactjs.org) and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev). 

We want Crypto Port to feel intuitive and easy to use and we're working hard to make it the best crypto portfolio tracker out there. To make it feel as intuitive as possible, we're making sure it's as fast as possible. We're always looking for ways to improve the user experience and we're open to any suggestions you might have. Please let us know in our Discord server.

We also know you love your privacy. This is why we're making sure Crypto Port as secure as possible, hence the use of Tauri. We also don't track you. We're also open source, so you can check the code yourself. If you have any suggestions, please open a PR or an issue.

**Important:** Crypto Port is still very early on its devlopment and is not ready for production use. We're working hard to make it ready as soon as possible.
